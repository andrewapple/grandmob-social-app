# Grandmob.App

Building a social media app for the family only. An Apple clan intranet of sorts. 

## Overview

The basic social media functionality will be there. Profiles. Posts. Reactions. Comments. Comment Replies. 

## Fun Features

I want to add some fun stuff for fun. A wishlist for each user so buying birthday gifts is less guessing and more of a guided adventure. I want a Rushmore section for people to share their favs of everything.
I want to add a calendar feature for all family events. Maybe use a GCal embed. Or something similar that is synced with master calendar managed by Queen Shlynstall.

## Deployment

We'll do it live!:
